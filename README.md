## Python Sneakerbot
Shoe bot created in Python that will auto purchase shoes from Adidas website.

Since I can't do it manually because everyone else uses bots I wanted to create my own.

As of right now it will just ask for the model # of the shoe and your size. Then

## On Hold... for now
To go further I will need to buy proxies... bot sure if I want to do that yet.
If I do decide to buy them I will finish the program. 

Also might be able to create it as more of a proof of concept w/o proxies
